    In computer vision field, object counting in images is a basic problem that needs to solve before solving complex problem. Object counting has many practical applications in real life. A system that can count the number of cells can be deployed in a hospital to estimate how many cells in the samples, help analysis blood samples to diagnostic more efficient. On the street, A counting system can also be installed to count the number of vehicles, detect traffic jam and notify drivers to change to another road, there is no need to monitor the road manually. If such systems are developed and widely used, they will hugely reduce the cost and human effort. With those motivations, this thesis researches on building a the counting application. Specifically, the thesis studies a density-based counting method. thereby building application using that method.
