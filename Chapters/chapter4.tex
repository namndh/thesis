\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusions}
In this thesis, I studied the counting problem in computer vision using the density estimation proposed in \cite{Lempitsky:Zisserman:Destimate}, and built application in practical. The main contributions of this thesis are listed as below:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reimplement the existing the learning function in C++ language. It has good result by estimation number of object almost correctly.
    \item Create application that has features for support client: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Marker: create training set for multi-kinds for object.  
        \item Trainer: train model for multi-kinds with training set from Marker. It has been integrated learning method proposed by Lempitsky V, Zisserman A \cite{Lempitsky:Zisserman:Destimate} for training state. 
        \item Runner: estimate number of object for each types of object with models trained by Train.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work} 
In future, the application will be improved by: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding a tool that supports client create dictionary
    \item Reduce the training and estimation time
    \item Add a feature that allows client can set region of interest to images in training and estimating state.
\end{itemize}
